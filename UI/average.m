function [ averagedExcitation ] = average( fineExcitation, dimensions )
%% Averages a fine-grained excitation pattern into a coarser excitation pattern
%  <fineExcitation> is a Y x Z x T matrix
%  <dimensions> = [d1,d2,d3] or [d1, d2] or [d1]
%  <averagedExcitation> is a d1 x d2 x T matrix or a d1 x Z x T matrix
%  
%  T may be 1, so that <fineExcitation> is just a 2 dimensional matrix
%  Z may be 1, so that <fineExcitation> is just a 1 dimensional array
%
%  <dimensions> will usually be smaller than or equal to the dimensions of
%  <fineExcitation>. 
%
%  For Example,
%           fineExcitation:  [1  2]
%                            [3  4]
%                            [5  6]
%                            [7  8]
%
%           dimensions: [2,1,1]
%           
%           averagedExcitation: [10/4]
%                               [26/4]
%
%  This process would be applied to each timeslice, but no interpo
%  (timeslice 1 is fineExcitation(:,:,1)) for matrices with more than one
%  timeslice.  
%
%   If Y and Z dimensions of <fineExcitation> are not easily
%  divided by dimension sizes specified in <dimensions>, like converting 4
%  rows into 3 rows, fractional portions of each row are averaged together.
%
%  For Example,
%           fineExcitation: [1  2]
%                           [3  4]
%                           [5  6]
%                           [7  8]
%
%           dimensions: [3,2,1]
%                           
%           averagedExcitation:        / [3/3+ 3/3   6/3+ 4/3] \
%                              (3/4)* |  [6/3+10/3   8/3+12/3]  |
%                                      \ [5/3+21/3   6/3+24/3] /
%
%   The first output row is the average of (1)*the first input row + (1/3)*the
%   second input row.  The second output row is the average of (2/3)*the
%   second input row + (2/3) * the third output row.  The third output row
%   is the average of (1/3)*the third output row + (1)*the fourth output row,
%   for a total of each input row appearing (4/3) times.  Then everything
%   is multiplied by (3/4) to offset that.  A similar process allows for
%   the averagedExcitation to have larger dimensions that fineExcitation,
%   although that is not expected.
